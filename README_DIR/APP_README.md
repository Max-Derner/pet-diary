#### __local_use/__
This `local_use/` directory is intended to house all of the code for the app you can run from your machine.
* [local_use/](../app/local_use/)

#### __support/__
This directory holds code which is intended to support the Lambdas, some of that code is also used by the `local_use/` directory.
