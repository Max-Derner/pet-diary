## This is my personal TODO list, you may look at it to see what's up and coming
#### If you're using this application for some reason and would like to see me prioritise something, or you have some suggestions of features. Please do et me know.

Look at the merits of VPC with WAF

Give daily reminder it's own SMS formatter that's a bit more phone friendly

Look into changing the format of the time fields in DynamoDB. Go from timestamp -> utc string

Look at shifting that bit in the record factory "additional validation" or whatever, and make them into proper Pydantic validators (e.g. https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/validators/#before-after-wrap-and-plain-validators)  
Hope is just to keep everything a little cleaner and more together. Well... and to learn more about Pydantic.
